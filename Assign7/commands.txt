	6. Now need to add our calculator service to client as:
		right click on client vala project. Add new WEB SERVICE CLIENT.
		inside that browse project of calculatorWebService. and select that created
		web service for calculator (Server we can say)!! Now we get the reference of Server

		Right click on client project. Add new SERVLET and give name as same which we have
		written in action attribute inside form tag. click next. check the check box for deployment.

	8. Now need to add the methods which are in reference in clientService inside this servlet file.
            For that, drag and drop those referenced methods (each inside that servlet file)
	9. Fetch the numbers/input from the form in servlet page to perform operations using:
		request.getParameter("name_of_paramter_used_in_form"), this method returns string
		bydefault. if need to fetch double values need to typecast it! -> Double.parseDouble();
	10. Use the method name directly inside the servlet file (inside h1 tag; default je asel te change kr)
	      like add, divide, etc. and pass the parameters fetched from request!!
	11. Cleand and build the client project
	12. Run the file in which we have written form tags (client's index.js)
